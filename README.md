# Jack Baek - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I am Jack! I have completed my BA in Economics. I have a strong foundation in economic concepts and a passion for using data to discover new findings. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kuWMVC0Wsx_7qDCw1pLy8uRjf1gBqMFN/view?usp=sharing). 

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
